The corrected CSS, which addresses the issues presented in `bug.css`, is shown below.

```css
/* Correct usage of calc() */
width: calc(100% - 5px);
height: calc(50% + 10px); /* Correct if percentage refers to parent element */
height: calc(50vh + 10px); /* Correct if percentage refers to viewport height */
margin: calc(60px);
```

This version ensures consistent spacing, correct unit handling, and simplified nesting to improve readability and prevent layout problems.
